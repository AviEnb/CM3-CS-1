My Name is Avi Engbrecht and I'm a BBA student from Germany at Hult International Business School.

During my high school time and part-time work, I was already able to gain some insights and experience in coding with HTML, PHP, and EXCEL functions.
Right now, I'm looking forward to learn about Python with GitHub. To know about the basics in coding is essential in a world 
where technology is part of everything, especially in the business world. 
Even though I do not intend to career in IT, I'm still really motivated to learn the basic of coding and get challegend outside my comfot zone.
